Service 1: Text to Braille
When the user clicks "Try It", they should be taken inside the Text to Braille tool.

Inside, there should be a text input box. When the user types anything in it:

The Braille output should appear instantly as they type.

Under each character of the text, show its Braille dot representation (i.e., Braille language form).

Display both the regular text and the Braille dots in black or any visible color (avoid white) so that it's clearly visible.

Microphone Feature:
When the mic button is clicked, it should start recording.

It should recognize the user's speech and display the recognized text in the input box.

Then convert that text into Braille and show:

The recognized text

And the Braille representation of each character under it, in the output section.

Read Aloud:
Add a "Read Aloud" button with a sound icon.

When clicked:

It should read the text aloud.

For Hindi text, it should read in Hindi.

For English text, it should read in English.

Make sure this works well even after deployment and functions correctly inside Android Studio WebView and APK (since usually read aloud doesnâ€™t work well in Android Studio).

Service 2: Image to Braille
Add a language selection option: Hindi / English.

Let users upload an image using drag-and-drop or a file upload button.

For English:
If the user selects English and uploads an image containing English text:

Extract and display the recognized text from the image.

Show the extracted text in black or visible colors (not white).

Convert the extracted text into Braille, showing:

Braille output

And below each character, its corresponding Braille dot representation.

For Hindi:
If the user selects Hindi and uploads a Hindi image:

Extract the Hindi text and display it in the Extracted Text section in a visible color.

Convert that Hindi text into Braille, showing:

Braille output

And under each Hindi letter or vowel/matra, show its Braille form using Braille dots.

Read Aloud:
Add a Read Aloud button:

When clicked in English mode, it reads the extracted English text aloud in English.

When clicked in Hindi mode, it reads the extracted Hindi text aloud in Hindi.

Ensure the Read Aloud works on deployed version and inside Android Studio WebView.
